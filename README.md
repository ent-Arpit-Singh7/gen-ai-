# Generative AI – Code Repository

This repository contains all the code, notebooks, and mini-projects I wrote for my **Generative AI** class.

It includes examples and experiments with:
- Text generation
- Prompt engineering
- Fine-tuning / training small models
- Working with embeddings
- Basic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- Image / multimodal (if applicable)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repo is mainly for learning and reference. It is **not** optimized for production use.
